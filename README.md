# Series Tracker Backend
## Description
The Series Tracker is a simple web application designed to help users manage their backlog of TV series. It allows users to track the status of their favorite series, 
monitor their progress, and organize their viewing experience. Developed as part of an educational exercise, we were given an existing frontend found [here](https://github.com/denn1s/series-tracker) and
required to implement the necessary API endpoints to handle its functionality
